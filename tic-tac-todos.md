   Tic Tac Toe, game of your childhood - game of your life or chess of the pleebs or really, this is how you get off?

MVP -
- User Account create and sign-in
- a three, by three grid
   - flexbox?
- each box has a binary option to be either X or O
-  triggering mecanism for whether an X or O is played (this can be done with a
      - type of token that equal either 0 or 1 and that toggles between the two, if the
        user clicks the square while the token is 0 an "o" is generated, if the click
        while the token is a 1 and "x" is generated)
- a button to reset the board.
- if .val() of every square !== to '', tie!













would-be-funs
   - option to enable tic-tac-trivia, trivial alerts (maybe an updating sidebar)
     with every tile played
   - Total number of games played tracker
     number of consecutive wins per user (streak counter) - perhaps complete with
     a leader board.
   - pretty images on x's and o's rather than text
      - an animation of an x or o being drawn if the box
  - when a player hits play, the rest of the screen fades away and there is just
    the board which enlarges slightly
  - provide option for larger boards (easy medium and hard levels)
  - "free" option to play basic without signing up but with an alert when the
     user clicks play that delares the advantages of signing up, more levels,
    trivia, score tracking and more!
    feature to match the user with a different user upon request so they can
    challenge eachother!
